types of probability distributions

finite number of outcomes -> discrete distributions
infinite many outcomes -> continuous distributions 

notation 
x ~ n 



distribution - the possible values a variable can take and how frequently they occur.

Y the actual outcome of an event 
y one of the possible outcomes

p(y) p(Y = y)

Y = the number of red marbles we draw out of a bag
y = 3

P (Y = 3)
p(y) = possibility function
probabilities measure the likelihood of an outcome.

mean average values muu
variance how spread out the data is  sigma.sqr - how far away from mean spreaded data

populatino data all the data
sample data just a part of it

x.bar s.sqr in sample data



standard deviation - positive sqr root of sigma.sqr 


mue - sigma ( data ) mue + sigma 

the more congested the middle of the distribution , the more data falls within that interval 
the less data falls within the interval the more dispersed the data is

#probability distributions

probability - chance of an event occuring
probability distribution - a function that describes the likelihood of obtaining the possible values that a random variable can take

between 0 and 1

Event of random experiment - a subset of the sample space
Sample space - the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment
Random variable - a variable whose value is subject to variations due to chance

sample space in set 
n(s) = 2 , s = { h , t} 


Event A 
A = { h }
n(A ) = 1

p(A) = n(A) / n(s) = 1/2
p(A) = 0.5

two coin tosses
s = { hh , ht , th , tt }

dice 
s = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 }
B even { 2 , 4 , 6 }
n(B) = 3
p(B) = n(B) / n(s) = 3/6 = 0.5




Random variable - a variable whose value is subject to variations due to chance

no.of head = x - random variable

discrete random variable - a variable that can take on a countable number of values - countable random variable
continuous random variable - a variable that can take on an infinite number of values within a given range - not in perfect number counting (infinte ) set of random numbers

probability mass function ,
probability density function
cumilative distribution function

r.v. (x) no of heads 
x = { 0 , 1 , 2 } { tt , (ht, th) , hh }
p(x) = p(X = x) 
p(x = 0) = 1/4
p(x = 1) = 2/4
p(x = 2) = 1/4
